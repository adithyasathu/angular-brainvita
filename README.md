# Brainvita (Peg Solitaire) - The Game

A Simple single player game created to kill the boredom.

**Rules of the game**

* Move one marble over the other either horizontally or vertically onto empty space, no cheeky diagonal moves.
* A legal move clears the marble you jumped over. X-X-O becomes O-O-X (X is marble and O is empty place).
* Continue moving one marble over the other till you leave only ONE marble on the board.


**Areas of improvement**

* Drag Drop Animations
* Convert to IONIC or NativeScript to make this mobile native app for Andriod and IOS
